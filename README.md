## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment & Resource Considerations

Ernest Bot utilizes `puppeteer` for its WhatsApp Web interactions, which means it runs a headless browser instance. While powerful, this has significant implications for deployment:

* **Resource Intensive:** Running a headless browser can be resource-intensive, especially on systems with limited RAM. If deployed on devices like phones with small RAM, this might lead to noticeable lag and performance issues.
* **Cloud Hosting Requirements:** The bot requires hosting environments that support running web instances and offer sufficient resources.
    * **Compatible Platforms:** Ideal for deployment on platforms like [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/), which are designed to handle web services and provide necessary resources.
    * **Incompatible Platforms:** It **cannot** run on servers like Katabump, as they typically do not provide the environment required for web instances and browser automation.

### **Addressing "Sleeping" Bots (Keeping Ernest Alive!)**

Many free or low-tier cloud hosting providers tend to put applications to "sleep" after a period of inactivity to conserve resources. This can cause your bot to become unresponsive.

But worry not, **Ernest Tech House always has a solution!** We've developed a dedicated service to combat this:

* **Ernest Alive Keeper:** To maintain your bot's awakeness longer and prevent it from sleeping, we recommend utilizing `Ernest Alive Keeper`. You will need to get an account on our platform:
    [**https://ernest-alive-keeper.vercel.app/**](https://ernest-alive-keeper.vercel.app/)
    This service continuously pings your deployed bot instance, ensuring it remains active and responsive.
